# Wikijump

Wikijump is the [SCP Wiki](http://www.scpwiki.com/)'s fork of the unmaintained [Wikidot](https://github.com/gabrys/wikidot).
It aims to significantly refactor legacy code, remove misfeatures and dead code, and implement new useful features and bugfixes that current users of Wikidot need today.

This project is being developed by the SCP Wiki's [Technical Team](http://05command.wikidot.com/technical-staff-main) as part of Project Foundation.
Issues are tracked on our [JIRA](https://scuttle.atlassian.net/browse/WDBUGS).

Questions, comments or suggestions can be suggested in the [Feature Requests forum](http://www.scpwiki.com/forum/c-3335630/feature-requests), or in [`#site11` on SkipIRC](http://www.scpwiki.com/chat-guide).

### Getting Started
