    # -- INDIVIDUAL BLOCK DOCUMENTATION

    # format:

    #   INFO: <detailed description>
    #   EXAMPLE: <example codeblock>
    #
    # The block INFO is rendered with FTML.

    anchor:
      TITLE: Anchor
      INFO: >
        Creates links between pages or other web pages. Like the HTML {{<a>}} tag, the
        {{href}} attribute needs to be used with the {{[[anchor]]}} block.
      EXAMPLE: |
        [[a href="/scp-4000/noredirect/true" target="_blank" class="dual-link"]]Fae[[/a]]

    blockquote:
      TITLE: Blockquote
      INFO: >
        Indicates that enclosed text is an extended quotation,
        although the "extended quotation" interpretation of blockquotes
        may not be how they're used in practice. The meaning of blockquotes
        differs from site-to-site and often depends on the styling given to them.

        Using the {{[[blockquote]]}} block is the same as using {{> text}},
        with the difference only being the syntax used.
      EXAMPLE: |
        [[blockquote]]
        Some text here.
        [[/blockquote]]
        [!-- equivalent to --]
        > Some text here.

    bold:
      TITLE: Bold
      INFO: >
        Bolds the enclosed text.
        Using {{[[bold]]}} is the same as using {{@<**bold**>@}},
        with the difference only being the syntax used.
      EXAMPLE: |
        Some [[b]]text![[/b]]
        [!-- equivalent to --]
        Some **text!**

    char:
      TITLE: Char
      INFO: >
        Renders an HTML entity (a special character) in place of the block.

        Note: The syntax for HTML entities is simplified for convinence. Normally,
        you would need to write {{&copy;}} to display the copyright symbol in HTML, but
        with the {{[[char]]}} block you just need to write {{copy}}.

        [[[https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref | List of HTML entities]]]
      EXAMPLE: |
        This file is [[char copy]] 2021 Team Wikijump.
