blocks:
  anchor:
    TITLE: Anchor
    INFO: >
      Creates links between pages or other web pages. Like the HTML {{<a>}} tag, the
      {{href}} attribute needs to be used with the {{[[anchor]]}} block.
    EXAMPLE: |
      [[a href="/scp-4000/noredirect/true" target="_blank" class="dual-link"]]Fae[[/a]]

  blockquote:
    TITLE: Blockquote
    INFO: >
      Indicates that enclosed text is an extended quotation,
      although the "extended quotation" interpretation of blockquotes
      may not be how they're used in practice. The meaning of blockquotes
      differs from site-to-site and often depends on the styling given to them.

      Using the {{[[blockquote]]}} block is the same as using {{> text}},
      with the difference only being the syntax used.
    EXAMPLE: |
      [[blockquote]]
      Some text here.
      [[/blockquote]]
      [!-- equivalent to --]
      > Some text here.

  bold:
    TITLE: Bold
    INFO: >
      Bolds the enclosed text.
      Using {{[[bold]]}} is the same as using {{@<**bold**>@}},
      with the difference only being the syntax used.
    EXAMPLE: |
      Some [[b]]text![[/b]]
      [!-- equivalent to --]
      Some **text!**

  char:
    TITLE: Char
    INFO: >
      Renders an HTML entity (a special character) in place of the block.

      Note: The syntax for HTML entities is simplified for convinence. Normally,
      you would need to write {{&copy;}} to display the copyright symbol in HTML, but
      with the {{[[char]]}} block you just need to write {{copy}}.

      [[[https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref | List of HTML entities]]]
    EXAMPLE: |
      This file is [[char copy]] 2021 Team Wikijump.

  checkbox:
    TITLE: Checkbox
    INFO: >
      Creates an interactive checkbox input that can be checked or unchecked.

      Providing the {{*}} prefix sets the checkbox to start checked.
    EXAMPLE: |
      [[checkbox Apple]]
      [[*checkbox Blueberry]]
      [[checkbox Cherry]]
      [[checkbox Durian]]

  code:
    TITLE: Code
    INFO: >
      Renders the enclosed text raw, with all whitespace preserved.
      Intended for use with programming code and the like.

      Providing the {{type}} argument sets the enclosed text to be
      rendered with syntax highlighting, if the specified language
      is available.
    EXAMPLE: |
      [[code]]
      This text is **not** rendered as Wikitext, but output as-is!
      [[/code]]
      [!-- or, with syntax highlighting --]
      [[code type="javascript"]]
      console.log("foo"); // syntax highlighted as JS!
      [[/code]]

  collapsible:
    TITLE: Collapsible
    INFO: >
      Creates an interactive block that can be expanded or folded,
      and when expanded, will display its contents.
    EXAMPLE: |
      [[collapsible
        show="+ Spoilers for Ouroboros"
        hide="- Spoilers!"
        hideLocation="bottom"
      ]]
      Overseers die.
      [[/collapsible]]

  css:
    TITLE: CSS
    INFO: >
      Adds a CSS stylesheet to the page, using the enclosed text as the source.
    EXAMPLE: |
      [[css]]
      #page-title {
        color: purple;
      }
      [[/css]]

  del:
    TITLE: Deletion
    INFO: >
      Denotes that the enclosed text has been "deleted" from the document.
      The text is not literally deleted, instead, it is styled or otherwise
      set to appear as deleted.

      Depending on context, this may have different meanings. In the context
      of a story, the deleted text may be a storytelling element, representing
      something diagetically deleted from a document. In a programming context,
      it may represent code that was deleted from a file, e.g. in a diff.
    EXAMPLE: |
      I [[del]]don't[[/del]] like that haircut.

  div:
    TITLE: Div
    INFO: >
      Creates a generic block container element,
      which may be styled, given a class/ID, etc.
    EXAMPLE: |
      [[div_ class="blockquote" style="border: none;"]]
      Some text __here!__
      [[/div]]

  footnote:
    TITLE: Footnote
    INFO: >
      Adds an expandable footnote, which a reader may use to view the contents by of
      hovering or focusing on a numbered marker. The footnote's contents will also be
      displayed in a "footnote block" at (by default) the bottom of the page.
    EXAMPLE: |
      The author of The Dark Tower series[[footnote]]Did you know that world-renowned writer Stephen King was once hit by a car? Just something to consider.[[/footnote]] began work in the late 1970s.

  footnote-block:
    TITLE: Footnote Block
    INFO: >
      Moves the footnote block. The "footnote block" is added to a page whenever it has
      any {{[[footnote]]}} elements, and by default it's placed at the bottom of the
      page. This block lets you move it, if so desired. If having a footnote block at
      all is undesirable, you can use the {{hide}} argument to remove it.
    EXAMPLE: |
      [[footnote-block title="Endnotes"]]
      [[footnote-block title="Stephen King Car Crash Facts"]]

  hidden:
    TITLE: Hidden
    INFO: >
      Styles the enclosed block of text as being hidden.
      This block does not delete or otherwise prevent the enclosed text from
      being rendered, instead, it sets the text to be invisible. A reader who
      is persistent enough will be able to find the text.
    EXAMPLE: |
      This text is **visible**.
      [[hidden]]
      This text is not.
      [[/hidden]]

  html:
    TITLE: HTML
    INFO: >
      Renders the enclosed block of text in an {{<iframe>}} element.
      In other words, it allows the insertion of arbitrary HTML markup in a safe way.
      This can be used to embed widgets or even games.
    EXAMPLE: |
      [[html]]
      <h2>Exciting!</h2>
      <p>
      This HTML will appear in an iframe hosted on wjfiles!
      </p>
      [[/html]]

  ifcategory:
    TITLE: ifcategory
    INFO: >
      Sets the enclosed text to be conditionally rendered depending on if the
      page is in, or is not in, certain categories.

      Syntax:

      * {{+<category>}} Requires that the page is in the category.

      * {{-<category>}} Requires that the page //is not// in the category.

      Additionally, the {{+}} prefix can be omitted, as in just typing {{<category>}}.
      The {{+}} is assumed if no other prefix is present.

      Finally, as a page cannot be in more than one category at once, having multiple
      {{+<category>}} statements acts as an {{OR}} conditional. In other words,
      the page has to be //in one of// the listed (positive) categories.
    EXAMPLE: |
      [[ifcategory _default]]
      Will render if the page is in the default category.
      [[/ifcategory]]

      [[ifcategory +_default +component -fragment]]
      This will render if the page is in either the _default or component categories.
      But if the page is in the fragment category, this won't render.
      [[/ifcategory]]

      [[ifcategory -_default]]
      Will only render if the page is in a category that isn't the default.
      [[/ifcategory]]

  iftags:
    TITLE: iftags
    INFO: >
      Sets the enclosed text to be conditionally rendered depending on if the
      page does or does not have certain tags.

      Syntax:

      * {{<tag>}} Requires that this tag, or any other {{<tag>}}, is present.

      * {{+<tag>}} Requires that the tag is present.

      * {{-<tag>}} Requires that the tag //is not// present.

      To explain the first syntax ({{<tag>}}) further, all {{<tag>}} statements are
      "lumped together" and checked. If _any_ of them are present, this check passes.
      This is exactly like an {{OR}} conditional. This differs from how the {{+<tag>}}
      and {{-<tag>}} syntaxes behave, which demand that the tag is or is not present.
    EXAMPLE: |
      [[iftags +science]]
      This page is labeled as: science.
      [[/iftags]]

      [[iftags +bug -fixed]]
      This is a bug, and it's not fixed yet.
      [[/iftags]]

  iframe:
    TITLE: iframe
    INFO: >
      Creates an {{<iframe>}} element in place. This allows for the embedding of
      external content, given an URL to said content.
      This is similar to the {{[[html]]}} element.
    EXAMPLE: |
      My website:
      [[iframe https://example.com/ class="website"]]

  image:
    TITLE: Image
    INFO: >
      Embeds an image in the rendered document.

      Accepts the following prefixes:

      * {{=}} Centers the image

      * {{<}} Aligns the image to the left

      * {{>}} Aligns the image to the right

      * {{f<}} Floats the image to the left, allowing text to wrap around it

      * {{f>}} Floats the image to the right, allowing text to wrap around it
    EXAMPLE: |
      [[image green_apple.png alt="A green apple" title="Take a big bite!" style="width: 100%;" class="fruity"]]
      [[image https://example.com/my-image.png]]
      [[image /some-other-page/my-picture.jpeg]]
      [[=image landscape.png]]
      [[<image landscape.png]]
      [[>image landscape.png]]
      [[f<image landscape.png]]
      [[f>image landscape.png]]
      [[image filename.png link="#section"]]
      [[image filename.png link="SCP-001"]]
      [[image filename.png link="https://example.com/"]]

  include-elements:
    TITLE: Include (Elements)
    INFO: >
      Injects another page's contents. This lets you //include// something without
      copy-pasting it, which allows for reusable content, like pre-made headers and
      footers. Includes can accept arguments, and these arguments replace any
      placeholders of the same name when the page is injected.
    EXAMPLE: |
      [[include-elements component:some-bar
        class="Keter"
        classification="4"
        taskforce="MTF-Eta-10 (\"See No Evil\")"
      ]]

  include-messy:
    TITLE: Include (Messy)
    INFO: >
      You shouldn't use this block unless you have to. This block takes another page's
      contents and literally pastes it directly into your page's source prior to
      rendering. The only reason it exists is for compatibility with Wikidot content.
      Use {{[[include-elements]]}} instead.
    EXAMPLE: |
      [[include-messy theme:black-highlighter-theme]]

      [[include-messy component:fancy-object-class
        class=Keter |
        classification=4 |
        taskforce=MTF-Eta-10 ("See No Evil")
      ]]

  ins:
    TITLE: Insertion
    INFO: >
      Denotes that the enclosed text has been "inserted" into the document.
      This does not insert the enclosed text in some special way, instead, it is
      styled or otherwise set to appear inserted.

      Depending on context, this may have different meanings. In the context
      of a story, the inserted text may be a storytelling element, representing
      something diagetically inserted into a document. In a programming context,
      it may represent new code that was inserted into a file, e.g. in a diff.
    EXAMPLE: |
      I would like some [[ins]]anchovy[[/ins]] pizza please, thank you.

  invisible:
    TITLE: Invisible
    INFO: >
      Styles the enclosed span of text as being invisible.
      This does not delete or otherwise prevent the enclosed text from
      being rendered, instead, it sets the text to be invisible. A reader who
      is persistent enough will be able to find the text.
    EXAMPLE: |
      This text appears [[invisible]]but still takes up space, and can be selected.[[/invisible]]

  italics:
    TITLE: Italics
    INFO: >
      Sets the enclosed text to be italicized.
      Using {{[[italics]]}} is the same as using {{@<//italics//>@}},
      with the difference only being the syntax used.
    EXAMPLE: |
      This text is regular, but [[em]]this text is emphasized[[/em]].
      [!-- equivalent to --]
      This text is regular, but //this text is emphasized//.

  lines:
    TITLE: Lines
    INFO: >
      Adds a specified number of newlines to the document.
    EXAMPLE: |
      [[newlines 4]]
      [!-- Much easier than spamming "@@@@"s --]

  list-item:
    TITLE: List-Item
    INFO: >
      Creates an item for a list. A list-item can only be placed inside either a
      {{[[ul]]}} (unordered list) or {{[[ol]]}} (ordered list) block.
    EXAMPLE: |
      [[ul]]
        [[ol]]
          [[li]] Item A [[/li]]
          [[li]] Item B [[/li]]
        [[/ol]]

        [[li]] Item C [[/li]]
      [[/ul]]

  list-ordered:
    TITLE: Ordered List
    INFO: >
      Starts an ordered list, which is a list that is sorted in order, e.g. with
      numbers or the alphabet. The children of this element should only be {{[[ul]]}}, {{[[ol]]}}, or {{[[li]]}} blocks.
    EXAMPLE: |
      [[ul]]
        [[ol]]
          [[li]] Item A [[/li]]
          [[li]] Item B [[/li]]
        [[/ol]]

        [[li]] Item C [[/li]]
      [[/ul]]

  list-unordered:
    TITLE: Unordered List
    INFO: >
      Starts an unordered list. The children of this element should only be {{[[ul]]}}, {{[[ol]]}}, or {{[[li]]}} blocks.

  monospace:
    TITLE: Monospace
    INFO: >
      Styles the enclosed text as being monospaced.
      This does not escape or otherwise affect the formatting of the text,
      it simply styles it.

      Using {{[[tt]]}} is the same as using {{@<{{monospace}}>@}},
      with the difference only being the syntax used.
    EXAMPLE: |
      [[tt]]This looks like it came from a typewriter or computer terminal.[[/tt]]
      [!-- equivalent to --]
      {{This looks like it came from a typewriter or computer terminal.}}

  paragraph:
    TITLE: Paragraph
    INFO: >
      Creates a paragraph element. This is normally done automatically, using the flow
      of linebreaks and blocks to determine where paragraphs should be placed.
      However, using this block allows avoiding the need to use {{[[div]]}} or
      {{[[span]]}} blocks as wrappers.
    EXAMPLE: |
      [[p class="fruits"]]
      Apple, Banana, Cherry!
      [[/p]]

  radio:
    TITLE: Radio
    INFO: >
      Creates an interactive radio-button input that can be selected or unselected.
      The value given for the block sets the radio-button's group.

      Providing the {{*}} prefix sets the radio-button to start selected.
    EXAMPLE: |

  span:
    TITLE: Span
    INFO: >
      Creates a generic inline container element,
      which may be styled, given a class/ID, etc.
    EXAMPLE: |
      This text is in a span:
      [[span class="fruit"]]banana[[/span]]

  strikethrough:
    TITLE: Strikethrough
    INFO: >
      Sets the enclosed text to be strucken.
      Using {{[[s]]}} is the same as using {{@<--strikethrough-->@}},
      with the difference only being the syntax used.
    EXAMPLE: |
      This text is [[s]]struck through![[/s]]
      [!-- equivalent to --]
      This text is --struck through!--

  subscript:
    TITLE: Subscript
    INFO: >
      Sets the enclosed text as being a subscript.
      Using {{[[sub]]}} is the same as using {{@<,,subscript,,>@}},

      Let this variable be called x[[sub]]A[[/sub]].
      [!-- equivalent to --]
      Let this variable be called x,,A,,.

  superscript:
    TITLE: Superscript
    INFO: >
      Sets the enclosed text as being a superscript.
      Using {{[[sup]]}} is the same as using {{@<^^sup^^>@}},
