The following fonts are used:
* [Cascadia Mono](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code) [SIL OFL1.1](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL)
* [Public Sans](https://public-sans.digital.gov/), [SIL OFL1.1](https://github.com/uswds/public-sans/blob/develop/LICENSE.md) (and partially public domain, as it is a work of the U.S. government)
* [Red Hat Display](https://github.com/RedHatOfficial/RedHatFont), [SIL OFL1.1](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL)
* [Bitter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bitter), [SIL OFL1.1](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL)

For the CJK fonts, the Noto family is used:
* [Noto CJK](https://www.google.com/get/noto/help/cjk/), [SIL OFL1.1](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL)

All fonts are in the `woff2` format for maximum compression. This is particularly important for the CJK fonts, which even after compression are multiple megabytes in size. If you need to add fonts, and don't know how to convert them to `woff2`, use this wonderful site: https://kombu.kanejaku.org/.

Additionally, the usage of variable fonts is encouraged. They are typically much smaller in file size compared to traditional fonts, and are by design much more versatile.
