# Contributing

This document assumes you have read [Development.md](development.md).

Wikijump has a fairly extensive scope and has lots of areas for people to contribute. Whether it's a small typofix or work on a potential new feature, there's always room for community contributions. If appropriate, a team member can make a [JIRA](https://scuttle.atlassian.net/browse/WJ) issue for it.

It is important that you join the Wikijump Discord so you can discuss and coordinate with the Wikijump team.  You can get an invitation by asking in [#site11](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/chat-guide).

Once you've implemented the changes, create a PR and request reviews from 1-3 relevant people. See [CODEOWNERS](../CODEOWNERS) to get an idea of who works on which parts of the repository. It'll be reviewed and merged if ready.

All changes should be merged against `develop`, which automatically deploys to `wikijump.dev`. In longer cycles, we take accrued changes in `develop` and produce a squash commit to `master`, which deploys to `wikijump.com` (the production environment). This way can utilize continuous deployment for development but also keep production stable. (See [CI.md](ci.md) for more information)
