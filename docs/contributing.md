# Contributing

This document assumes you have read [Development.md](docs/development.md).

Wikijump has a fairly extensive scope and has lots of areas for people to contribute. Whether it's a small typofix or work on a potential new feature, there's always room for community contributions.

It is important that you join the Wikijump discord guild so you can discuss and coordinate with the Wikijump team.  If appropriate, a team member can make a [JIRA](https://scuttle.atlassian.net/browse/WJ) issue for it. You can get an invitation by asking in [#site11](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/chat-guide).

Once you've implemented the changes, create a PR and request reviews from 1-3 relevant people. See [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS) to get an idea of who works on which parts of the repository. It'll be reviewed and merged if ready.
