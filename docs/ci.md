# Continuous Integration (CI)

We use [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) as our CI system. See the [`.github/workflows`](https://github.com/scpwiki/wikijump/tree/develop/.github/workflows) directory for our current list of jobs. By utilizing [GitHub Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) we can build, test, and deploy using GitHub Actions.
