# Local Development

This document will explain how to set up Wikijump on your machine for local development.

## Deployment

The `install` folder has everything you need to run a local Wikijump install either in a container or on metal or a VM.

The recommended way to install Wikijump is via Docker. Docker is a way of containerizing, or in the case of Windows or Mac, also virtualizing Linux images. It lets you easily create and destroy different Wikijump builds, and it also acts like a sandbox to protect the rest of your system from dependency pollution. 

> ### For Windows:
>
> For Windows, you will need WSL2, a way of running a Linux distribution simultaneously with Windows. You will need Windows 10 or 11 for this. The only alternative to WSL2 would be using a Linux virtual machine such as [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) â€” but using a VM isn't recommended, and is not covered by this document.
>
> It is recommended that you use Ubuntu for the WSL2 distribution. Ubuntu in particular has considerations made for WSL2 use and in general will be the most reliable way forward.

You will need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed and running:

<pre>$ sudo apt install docker.io</pre>

This example is for Ubuntu. Installation may be different depending on your Linux distro. See [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/) for more information.

After installing Docker, you can run it with the following commands:

<table>
<thead><tr><th>systemd Distros</th><th>WSL2</th></tr></thead>
<tbody valign="top">
<td><p><pre>$ sudo systemctl enable --now docker.service</pre></p></td>
<td><p><pre>$ sudo service docker start</pre></p></td>
</tbody>
</table>

## Setup: Utilities and Programs

You will need some utilities and programs to get started. You will to install the following:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (see above)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [NodeJS (and NPM, which comes with it), v15 or greater](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [PNPM v6](https://pnpm.io/installation)

Node, NPM, and PNPM are well-behaved on Windows and Linux, and the difference in usage between operating systems is negligible.

## Setup: Configuration

There are a couple of configuration files that need to be initialized prior to running your instance of Wikijump. These will be the `config.toml` and `.env` files, both located in the `deepwell` subdirectory. Both of these files can be copied from their `.example` counterparts without changing them, though it is worth looking through them briefly to understand what can be configurated for your instance.

There is also a Docker configuration file that configures the various containers that host Wikijump in the local environment. You can find this file in `install/local/dev/`, named `docker-compose.yaml`, alongside `docker-compose.dev.yaml` (which provides various helpful tools for developing locally).

Notice that in `docker-compose.yaml`, there are configuration options for the domains to use. For development purposes, these are set to `wikijump.localhost`. This is the domain you will be connecting to, e.g. `http://www.wikijump.localhost`. The TLD `.localhost` is just like the usual `localhost` domain. Even when running locally, HTTPS is used. Because this certificate is self-signed, you will need to dismiss the certificate warning.

## Setup: Dependencies

You will need to install Wikijump's NPM dependencies. Navigate to the `web/` directory and run the following:

```sh
$ pnpm install
```

## Building

You can now finally build the Docker images. Navigate to `install/local/dev` and run the following:

```sh
$ docker-compose -p wikijump -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up
```

_This might take some time_. Thankfully, Docker's build step is _heavily_ cached. 

> ### For Windows:
>
> You may encounter various errors involving file permissions if using Windows-based tools alongside WSL2. It is recommend that you fix these issues by either granting the correct file permissions to any that Windows may have modified, or by re-cloning the repository purely within WSL2.

Once everything has started, you can connect to `http://www.wikijump.localhost/`. Changes you make to the codebase should automatically be applied to the containers, as your machine's filesystem has been "bound" to the containers' filesystem. This is one-way, so a container can't modify your filesystem. Adding new dependencies, however, will require a rebuild.

You can just kill the terminal (`CTRL + C` usually) when you want to stop the server.

If you want to entirely _reset_ the containers, as their data is otherwise persistent even across restarts, you can run the following:

```sh
$ docker-compose -p wikijump -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.dev.yaml down
```

It's useful to keep track of existing Docker images and containers, and destroy them when you no longer need them, so you don't waste space rebuilding the same image over and over. If you are using Docker Desktop, you can manage containers and images from the GUI. Otherwise, using the command line:

```
$ docker container ls  # List containers
$ docker rm [ID]       # Destroy the container with this ID
$ docker images        # List images
$ docker rmi [ID]      # Remove the image with this ID
```


## Entering the container

If you want to enter a container to make temporary changes, you can do so by entering it with a CLI. From Docker Desktop, after running the containers, find the Wikijump app and within it the container you wish to enter, then click the 'CLI' button. Or from the command line:

```
$ docker exec -it [container id] sh
```

...where `[container id]` is the ID of the corresponding container from `docker ps`. (`sh` can be replaced with a different command.)

One reason you may need to enter the container is to manually adjust the Wikijump config. For example, if you use a port other than 80 for your Docker container, you will need to edit `site.custom_domain` to add the port number (e.g. "`www.wikijump.localhost:8080`"). Alternatively, use curl to set the domain directly (e.g. "`-H 'www.wikijump.localhost'`")

## Clock Drift

If you enable multi-factor authentication on a local container you may find that
the clock drift is too great for TOTP codes to work. In docker-compose (`wsl -d docker-compose`)
you can enter this command to sync your time up:

```
$ ntpd -d -q -n -p 0.pool.ntp.org
```
