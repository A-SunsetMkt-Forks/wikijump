## Wikijump Client Monorepo

> #### **IMPORTANT:**
> This monorepo uses [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/). You need to have it installed.
> ```
> $ npm install pnpm --global
> ```
> You will need to use PNPM to interact with this monorepo, and not `npm`.

### Relevant Documentation

* [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/)
* [uvu](https://github.com/lukeed/uvu)
* [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

### Getting Started

You will need a recent version of Node, specifically v15 or higher. The repo may work on older versions of Node but this hasn't been tested. You will also need PNPM, as noted above.

To get setup, run this command:
```
$ pnpm install
```

This will have PNPM install all the needed dependencies, even for workspace packages.

### Building

To build the monorepo, run this command:
```
$ pnpm build

or, if you want to force a complete build:
$ pnpm force-build
```

This will build all packages for which a build process has been setup. Most packages within the repo don't actually have a build step - this is because packages are usually intended to be consumed by something like a website bundler, and it would be mostly pointless to build the package if it would be built by the website bundler anyways.

> Packages in the repo tend to be designed for direct consumption by Vite - and thus use Vite's extra language features, such as URL imports. This makes them directly incompatible with being used in another environment, without some sort of Vite-based build step.

### Development

Currently, there is no "monorepo-wide" development mode. Since packages generally have their source directly consumed, there isn't any reason to be building them.

The website packages however, e.g. `web/dev-sandbox`, do have a development mode, which will respond to other packages in the monorepo changing.

### Testing

Running tests is simple:
```
$ pnpm test
```

This will create a "megabundle" in `tests-dist`, at root, compiled by Vite. This is a JS file and a sourcemap - of which contains the code of the _entire monorepo_, so that it may be instrumented to determine code coverage. All tests are included at the end of this bundle and then ran.

Tests are ran in a special environment that is Node CJS compatible but simulates a browser. Specifically, the [happy-dom](https://github.com/capricorn86/happy-dom) library is used.

At the end of testing, a code coverage report will be emitted. This coverage report should only contain source TypeScript and Svelte files - if it reports coverage for something that isn't one of those two, something has gone wrong. If it reports nothing, that also means something has gone wrong.

> #### **IMPORTANT:**
> If you need to use Instanbul code coverage comments, e.g:
> ```js
> /* istanbul ignore next */
> ```
> You need to do the following instead:
> ```js
> /*! istanbul ignore next */
> // note the exclamation point
> ```
> This is for technical reasons - build tools don't preserve normal comments but will preserve legal comments. These comments are automatically transformed by the test builder back into normal comments - but you need to mark them as "important" using that exclamation point.

### Linting, Validation

To lint the entire monorepo, simply do:
```
$ pnpm lint

or, if you want auto-fixes applied:
$ pnpm lint:fix
```

This will run ESLint, Prettier, and Stylelint. You can run a linter individually by appending `lint` (or `lint:fix`) with the name of the linter, e.g. `lint:eslint`.

You can run `tsc` (TypeScript) for typechecking with:
```
pnpm typecheck
```

If you want to run linting and typechecking at the same time, and have everything done in parallel, do:
```
pnpm validate
```

### Commands

Commands are just NPM scripts, defined in `nabs.yml` and then compiled to
`package.json` with `pnpm nabs`.

### Modules

See [`modules.md`](misc/docs/modules.md).
