This is the testing site for Wikijump. It is not meant to be used for serious pages, but instead of testing, development, debugging, and experiments. **Do not keep important data here! No drafts, policy documents, etc., act as if all pages could be deleted at any time!**

This site is invite-only. Membership is generally limited to Wikijump developers, Wikijump platform administrators, and others on a case-by-case basis.

This is a testing sandbox, but if you're going to cause large changes please give other members a heads-up first. Don't delete system pages (like this one), and avoid modifying with others' pages unless you know they won't mind.
