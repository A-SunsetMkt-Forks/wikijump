## Wikijump Legacy (deprecated)

This directory holds two kinds of legacy code: the original Wikidot PHP and related libraries, and Laravel PHP and early refactoring work.

It is maintained as a temporary reference, and is not intended to be run. As Wikidot or Laravel code is replaced, it can be deleted from this directory. (For a permanent archive of old Wikidot, see the [`legacy`](https://github.com/scpwiki/wikijump/tree/legacy) branch).
